TypeCast for the Google ChromeCast

So far I wrote this all in about 3 hours late at night so there are probably numerous bugs and issues. Please file them on the issue tracker if you find any.

You must first flash the nssdb via flashcast using the flashcast-mod `cert_mod`

After that you must install node.js on the device, then run `index.js` via `node` after installing `express` via `npm`.
